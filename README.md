To: Shas'O Vior'la Shovah Kais Mont'yr  
From: a friend in the old home.  

My very dearest O'Shova,

A friend of ours in the Earth caste has forwarded me information on a new devide
designed by our Engineers, which they call a Combat Emulator. The Fire caste has
been using it to great effect to anticipate the actions of our enemies in combat
and have already earned many accolades for their increased effectiveness in
battle.

Although the device is still a mere prototype (the Earth caste friend says it's
"still in beta") it can already simulate the outcome of a set of units firing
upon a single target, while taking into account both sides' movement and even
cover, to some degree. A full battlefield simulation is still a long way away,
but other aspects of combat are in the works. Our engineers sensibly considered
barbarous melee fighting not to be the primary objective. Some races primitive
superstitions regarding "psychic powers" will eventually have to be taken into
account also- they often seem capable of turning the tide of battle, therefore,
we must be prepared.

The device still lacks significant data on most of our enemies, or even our own
troops. The Earth caste is working to include more of our existing intelligence
but for the time being, only a few of our Fire caste troops are represented and
just a handful of our enemies, specifically a couple of types of units of the
Imperium of Man. I understand you've had some close encounters with their sort
recently, so I decided to forward the schematics of the Combat Emulator to you,
just in case you might find some use for it. 

Unfortunately, I could not secure any documentation regarding the operation of
the device, however I expect you will want to pass on the schematics to a
certain venerable Earth caste colleague of yours, who will be perfectly capable
of understanding how to use, and perhaps even begin improving, the Emulator. For
my part, I will make sure to keep you up-to-date with any new additions to the
device from the Engineers over here.

For the Greater Good  
Your old comrade in arms  
S.O.S.
